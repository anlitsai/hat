<p><h3>Voice Over:</h3><br>
Here I am going to talk about another astronomical activities in early taiwan. Eclipse.<br>
<br>
There was an eclipse happened on 1941, September 21th, and the total period of the eclipse continued for about 1.5 hours.<br>
This is the first official astronomical activity, many government, non-government departments join this activities.<br>
<br>
And the government also have radio broadcast to taiwan and japan. <br>
The company of broadcast was Taiwan Broadcasting, now it is BCC, Broadcasting Corporation of China.<br>
<br>
How was the eclipse in each city at that time? We can see from this table.<br><br>

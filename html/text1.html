<h3>Voice Over:</h3>

My motivation of this project is very simple, can anyone tell me the answer of 
those questions before you read my article?<br>
I did not know those answers, and can not find any answer from website, there 
is no book discuss about these questions.<br>
When I try to ask some people working in government deaprments, most people ask 
me, <br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><i>"Did you ask people working in ASIAA? They could know 
the answer."</i></strong></font><br>
<br>
Right! ASIAA has responsibility to all Taiwanese to find out those answers.<br>

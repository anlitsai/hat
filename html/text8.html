<h3>Voice Over:</h3>

OK, after sad story, we talk about astronomical activities in taiwan.<br>
First we talk about astronomical clubs.<br>
<br>
The first astronomical club was Astronomical Association, Taiwan Branch.<br>
The headquarters of Astronomical Association is in Kyoto, the founder is Yamamoto, 
Kazukiyo, professor of Kyoto University.<br>
Astronomical Association now change the name to <a href="http://www.amy.hi-ho.ne.jp/oaa-web/">Oriental 
Astronomical Association</a>.<br>
<br>
Astronomical Association Taiwan Branch probably built in 1931. I can not find 
the exactly year.<br>
I tried to contact with <a href="http://www.amy.hi-ho.ne.jp/oaa-web/">Oriental 
Astronomical Association</a> if they have any documents record the year Astronomical 
Association Taiwan Branch built. <br>
But unfortunately, no answered.<br>
<br>
So probably the first president is Mitoto Aatoru in 1931.<br>
The second president is Kubokawa, Kazuo.<br>
And their monthly journal is "South Star" <br>
<br>

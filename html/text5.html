<ul><li><h2>Second Observatory in Taiwan</h2>

<ul><li><h2>Taipei City Hall Observatory</h2>

</ul></ul><br>

<h3>Voice Over:</h3>

The second Observatory in Taiwan is Taipei City Hall Observatory.<br>

The telescope came from Taiwan Daily-New Paper.<br>

1938, Taiwan Daily-New Paper was 40 years old, they donate a 4 inch telescope to Taipei City. <br>
The detail of the donation from Taiwan Daily-New Paper shows next page.<br><br>

And then Taipei City Government started to build a dome in Taipei City Hall. <br>
Taipei City Hall Observatory started from 1939.<br>

The Second astronomical club in Taiwan, Celestial Bodies Observation Association, also started from 1941.<br><br>

1945, Chinese Government took over Taiwan, Taipei city Hall Observatory changed name to Chung-Shan Hall Observatory.<br>

Till 1963, more and more people living in the center of the city, so Chung-Shan Hall Observatory moved to Yuan-Shan.<br>

The first Taiwanese President of Astronomical Observatory is Mr. Tsai, Chang-Hsien.<br><br>

Here I didn't find the exactly year when Chung-Shan Hall Observatory dome be destroyed. Even the people in Astronomical Museum doesn't know the answer.<br>

Of course the 4-inch telescope also moved to Taipei Yuan-Shan Observatory.<br>

1996, Taipei Yuan-Shan Observatory extended to Taipei Astronomical Museum.<br><br>

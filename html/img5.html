<p><h3>Voice Over:</h3><br>
The second Observatory in Taiwan is Taipei City Hall Observatory.<br>
The telescope came from Taiwan Daily-New Paper.<br>
1938, Taiwan Daily-New Paper was 40 years old, they donate a 4 inch telescope to Taipei City.<br>
The detail of the donation from Taiwan Daily-New Paper shows next page.<br>
<br>
And then Taipei City Government started to build a dome in Taipei City Hall.<br>
Taipei City Hall Observatory started from 1939.<br>
The Second astronomical club in Taiwan, Celestial Bodies Observation Association, also started from 1941.<br>
<br>
1945, Chinese Government took over Taiwan, Taipei city Hall Observatory changed name to Chung-Shan Hall Observatory.<br>
Till 1963, more and more people living in the center of the city, so Chung-Shan Hall Observatory moved to Yuan-Shan.<br>
The first Taiwanese President of Astronomical Observatory is Mr. Tsai, Chang-Hsien.<br>
<br>
Here I didn't find the exactly year when Chung-Shan Hall Observatory dome be destroyed. Even the people in Astronomical Museum doesn't know the answer.<br>
Of course the 4-inch telescope also moved to Taipei Yuan-Shan Observatory.<br>
1996, Taipei Yuan-Shan Observatory extended to Taipei Astronomical Museum.<br>
